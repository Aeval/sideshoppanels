# SideShop Group Stage Panels

Just a tool for tournament group stage standings.

The teams and their IDs are manually input into a "teams" object and then it's looped through to generate data.

To add a team, simply add the team and it's ID into the JS object in <b><ul><standings.js></ul></b>

and then grab a png of the team logo from the cdn and throw it in the images folder.

The groups are not assigned, so I'll have to make two seperate objects for group A & B so that the teams and be placed correctly.

Also need a way to sort by wins...
